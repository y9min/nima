## 🔒 Privacy & Data Protection

### For Educators: FERPA Compliance

Complete FERPA compliance through systematic data anonymization when working with student data:

- **Source-level data anonymization** converts real names to consistent anonymous IDs (Student_xxxxxxxx)
- **Automatic email masking** and PII filtering from discussion posts and submissions
- **Local-only processing** with configurable privacy controls (`ENABLE_DATA_ANONYMIZATION=true`)
- **FERPA-compliant analytics**: Ask "Which students need support?" without exposing real identities
- **De-anonymization mapping tool** for faculty to correlate anonymous IDs with real students locally

All student data is anonymized **before** it reaches AI systems. See [Educator Guide](https://github.com/vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp/blob/main/docs/EDUCATOR_GUIDE.md) for configuration details.

### For Students: Your Data Stays Private

- **Your data only**: Student tools access only your own Canvas data via Canvas API's "self" endpoints
- **Local processing**: Everything runs on your machine - no data sent to external servers
- **No tracking**: Your Canvas usage and AI interactions remain private
- **No anonymization needed**: Since you're only accessing your own data, there are no privacy concerns

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** - Required for modern features and type hints
- **Canvas API Access** - API token and institution URL
- **MCP Client** - Any MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Zed, Windsurf, Continue, etc.)

### Canvas API Compatibility

Canvas MCP is compatible with Canvas LMS API and stays current with Canvas API changes:

📖 [View Full Tool Documentation](tools/README.md) for detailed information about all available tools.

## 🚀 Code Execution API (New!)

The Canvas MCP now supports **code execution patterns** for maximum token efficiency when performing bulk operations.

### When to Use Each Approach

**Traditional Tool Calling** (for simple queries):
```
Ask Claude: "Show me my courses"
Ask Claude: "Get assignment details for assignment 123"
```
✅ Best for: Single queries, small datasets, quick lookups

**Bulk Grade Submissions Tool** (for batch grading with predefined grades):
```
Ask Claude: "Grade these 10 students with their specific rubric scores"
```
✅ Best for: Batch grading when you already have the grades/scores, concurrent processing

**Code Execution** (for bulk operations with custom logic):
```
Ask Claude: "Grade all 90 Jupyter notebook submissions by analyzing each notebook"
Ask Claude: "Send reminders to all students who haven't submitted"
```
✅ Best for: Bulk processing with custom analysis logic, large datasets, complex conditions

### Token Savings Example

**Scenario**: Grading 90 Jupyter notebook submissions

| Approach | Token Usage | Efficiency |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Traditional** | 1.35M tokens | Loads all submissions into context |
| **Code Execution** | 3.5K tokens | **99.7% reduction!** 🎉 |

### Example: Bulk Grading

```typescript
import { bulkGrade } from './canvas/grading/bulkGrade';

await bulkGrade({
  courseIdentifier: "60366",
  assignmentId: "123",
  gradingFunction: (submission) => {
    // Analysis happens locally, not in Claude's context!
    const notebook = submission.attachments?.find(f =>
      f.filename.endsWith('.ipynb')
    );

    if (!notebook) return null; // Skip

    const hasErrors = analyzeNotebook(notebook.url);

    return hasErrors ? null : {
      points: 100,
      rubricAssessment: { "_8027": { points: 100 } },
      comment: "Great work! No errors."
    };
  }
});
```

### Example: Bulk Discussion Grading

Grade discussion posts with initial post + peer review requirements:

```typescript
import { bulkGradeDiscussion } from './canvas/discussions/bulkGradeDiscussion';

// Preview grades first (dry run)
await bulkGradeDiscussion({
  courseIdentifier: "60365",
  topicId: "990001",
  criteria: {
    initialPostPoints: 10,      // Points for initial post
    peerReviewPointsEach: 5,    // Points per peer review
    requiredPeerReviews: 2,     // Must review 2 peers
    maxPeerReviewPoints: 10     // Cap at 10 pts for reviews
  },
  dryRun: true  // Preview first!
});

// Then apply grades
await bulkGradeDiscussion({
  courseIdentifier: "60365",
  topicId: "990001",
  assignmentId: "1234567",  // Required to write grades
  criteria: {
    initialPostPoints: 10,
    peerReviewPointsEach: 5,
    requiredPeerReviews: 2,
    maxPeerReviewPoints: 10
  },
  dryRun: false
});
```

**Features:**
- Automatically analyzes initial posts vs peer reviews
- Configurable grading criteria with point allocation
- Optional late penalties with customizable deadline
- Dry run mode to preview grades before applying
- Concurrent processing with rate limiting
- Returns comprehensive participation analytics

### Discovering Available Tools

The Canvas MCP Server includes a **`search_canvas_tools`** MCP tool that helps you discover and explore available code execution API operations. This tool searches through the TypeScript code API files and returns information about available Canvas operations.

**Tool Parameters:**
- `query` (string, optional): Search term to filter tools by keyword (e.g., "grading", "assignment", "discussion"). Empty string returns all available tools.
- `detail_level` (string, optional): Controls how much information to return. Options:
  - `"names"`: Just file paths (most efficient for quick lookups)
  - `"signatures"`: File paths + function signatures + descriptions (recommended, default)
  - `"full"`: Complete file contents (use sparingly for detailed inspection)

**Example Usage:**

Ask Claude in natural language:
- *"Search for grading tools in the code API"*
- *"What bulk operations are available?"*
- *"Show me all code API tools"*

Or use directly via MCP:
```typescript
// Search for grading-related tools with signatures
search_canvas_tools("grading", "signatures")

// List all available tools (names only)
search_canvas_tools("", "names")

// Get full implementation details for bulk operations
search_canvas_tools("bulk", "full")

// Find discussion-related operations
search_canvas_tools("discussion", "signatures")
```

**Returns:**
JSON response with:
- `query`: The search term used
- `detail_level`: The detail level requested
- `count`: Number of matching tools found
- `tools`: Array of matching tools with requested detail level

### Code API File Structure

```
src/canvas_mcp/code_api/
├── client.ts              # Base MCP client bridge
├── index.ts               # Main entry point
└── canvas/
    ├── assignments/       # Assignment operations
    │   └── listSubmissions.ts
    ├── grading/          # Grading operations
    │   ├── gradeWithRubric.ts
    │   └── bulkGrade.ts  # ⭐ Bulk grading (99.7% token savings!)

    │   └── bulkGradeDiscussion.ts  # ⭐ Bulk discussion grading
    ├── courses/          # Course operations
    └── communications/   # Messaging operations
```

### How It Works

1. **Discovery**: Use `search_canvas_tools` to find available operations
2. **Execution**: Claude reads TypeScript code API files and executes them locally
3. **Processing**: Data stays in execution environment (no context cost!)
4. **Results**: Only summaries flow back to Claude's context

📖 [View Bulk Grading Example](examples/bulk_grading_example.md) for a detailed walkthrough.

### Code Execution Security

The `execute_typescript` tool provides powerful capabilities but requires clear boundaries. It always runs locally; sandboxing is optional and best-effort unless a container runtime is available.

**Security Modes:**
- **Default (no sandbox)**: Code runs with your local user permissions and full network access.
- **Sandbox (`ENABLE_TS_SANDBOX=true`)**: Applies optional limits (timeout, memory, CPU seconds) plus a Node-level outbound allowlist guard. If Docker/Podman is available and `TS_SANDBOX_MODE=auto`, code runs inside a container for stronger isolation (default image: `node:20-alpine` via `TS_SANDBOX_CONTAINER_IMAGE`).

**Best Practices:**
- **Trusted Environment Required**: Only use code execution in environments you control
- **Review Generated Code**: Always review TypeScript code before execution, especially for bulk operations
- **Resource Monitoring**: Monitor system resources when processing large datasets
- **Timeout Configuration**: Adjust timeout values based on expected operation duration

**What Code Execution Has Access To:**
- Canvas API credentials from your `.env` file
- All TypeScript modules in `src/canvas_mcp/code_api/`
- Standard Node.js modules and npm packages
- File system access under the current user or container permissions

**Limitations:**
- Network allowlist is enforced inside Node; external binaries spawned by user code are not blocked
- Container mode is optional; when unavailable, the server falls back to local execution with warnings
- File system isolation is only enforced when running inside a container

For technical implementation details, see `src/canvas_mcp/tools/code_execution.py`.

## Usage with MCP Clients

This MCP server works seamlessly with any MCP-compatible client:

1. **Automatic Startup**: MCP clients start the server when needed
2. **Tool Integration**: Canvas tools appear in your AI assistant's interface
3. **Natural Language**: Interact naturally with prompts like:

**Students:**
- *"What assignments do I have due this week?"*
- *"Show me my current grades"*
- *"What peer reviews do I need to complete?"*
- *"Have I submitted everything for BADM 350?"*

**Educators:**
- *"Which students haven't submitted the latest assignment?"*
- *"Create an announcement about tomorrow's exam"*
- *"Show me peer review completion analytics"*

## Technical Details

### Modern Architecture (2025)

Built with current Python ecosystem best practices:

- **Package Structure**: Modern `src/` layout with `pyproject.toml`
- **Dependency Management**: Fast `uv` package manager with locked dependencies
- **Configuration**: Environment-based config with validation and templates
- **Entry Points**: Proper CLI commands via `pyproject.toml` scripts
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints and runtime validation

### Core Components

- **FastMCP Framework**: Robust MCP server implementation with tool registration
- **Async Architecture**: `httpx` client with connection pooling and rate limiting
- **Smart Caching**: Intelligent request caching with configurable TTL
- **Configuration System**: Environment-based config with validation and defaults
- **Educational Focus**: Tools designed for real teaching workflows

### Dependencies

Modern Python packages (see `pyproject.toml`):
- **`fastmcp`**: MCP server framework
- **`httpx`**: Async HTTP client
- **`python-dotenv`**: Environment configuration
- **`pydantic`**: Data validation and settings
- **`python-dateutil`**: Date/time handling

### Performance Features

- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse HTTP connections for efficiency
- **Request Caching**: Minimize redundant Canvas API calls
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking I/O for concurrent requests
- **Smart Pagination**: Automatic handling of Canvas API pagination
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect Canvas API limits with backoff

### Development Tools

- **Automated Setup**: One-command installation script
- **Configuration Testing**: Built-in connection and config testing
- **Type Checking**: `mypy` support for type safety
- **Code Quality**: `ruff` and `black` for formatting and linting

For contributors, see the [Development Guide](https://github.com/vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp/blob/main/CLAUDE.md) for detailed architecture and development reference.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Server Won't Start** - Verify your [Configuration](#configuration) setup: `.env` file, virtual environment path, and dependencies
2. **Authentication Errors** - Check your Canvas API token validity and permissions
3. **Connection Issues** - Verify Canvas API URL correctness and network access
4. **Debugging** - Check your MCP client's console logs (e.g., Claude Desktop's developer console) or run server manually for error output

## Security & Privacy Features

### API Security
- Your Canvas API token grants access to your Canvas account
- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- The server runs locally on your machine - no external data transmission
- Consider using a token with limited permissions if possible

### Privacy Controls (Educators Only)

Educators working with student data can enable FERPA-compliant anonymization:

```bash
# In your .env file
ENABLE_DATA_ANONYMIZATION=true  # Anonymizes student names/emails before AI processing
ANONYMIZATION_DEBUG=true        # Debug anonymization (optional)
```

Students don't need anonymization since they only access their own data.

For detailed privacy configuration, see:
- **[Educator Guide](https://github.com/vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp/blob/main/docs/EDUCATOR_GUIDE.md)** - FERPA compliance and anonymization
- **[Student Guide](https://github.com/vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp/blob/main/docs/STUDENT_GUIDE.md)** - Privacy information for students

## Publishing to MCP Registry

This server is published to the [Model Context Protocol Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/) for easy installation.

### Automated Publishing (Recommended)

Publishing is automated via GitHub Actions:

1. **Prepare a release**:
   ```bash
   # Update version in pyproject.toml and src/canvas_mcp/__init__.py
   # Update CHANGELOG if applicable
   git commit -am "chore: bump version to X.Y.Z"
   git push
   ```

2. **Create and push a version tag**:
   ```bash
   git tag vX.Y.Z
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

3. **Automated workflows** (triggered by tag push):
   - **Publish workflow** (`publish-mcp.yml`):
     - Runs tests
     - Builds Python package
     - Publishes to PyPI
     - Publishes to MCP Registry using GitHub OIDC
   - **Release workflow** (`create-release.yml`):
     - Creates GitHub release with changelog
     - Updates README.md with latest release info
     - Commits README changes back to main branch

4. **Testing the release workflow** (optional):
   - The release workflow can be manually triggered from the Actions tab
   - Go to Actions → "Create Release and Update README" → Run workflow
   - Enter a test tag name (e.g., `v1.0.7-test`)
   - This allows testing without creating an actual release tag

### Prerequisites for Publishing

- **PyPI Account**: Create account at [pypi.org](https://pypi.org)
- **Trusted Publisher Setup** (recommended, no tokens needed):
  1. Visit [PyPI Trusted Publishers](https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/)
  2. Add a "pending publisher" for your repository:
     - **Owner**: `vishalsachdev`
     - **Repository**: `canvas-mcp`
     - **Workflow**: `publish-mcp.yml`
     - **Environment**: (leave blank)
  3. This reserves the package name and enables tokenless publishing

**Alternative**: Use API token (legacy method - not recommended):
- Generate token at PyPI → Account Settings → API tokens
- Add as `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret in repository settings
- Update workflow to use `password: ${{ secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN }}`

### Manual Publishing (Alternative)

For manual publishing:

```bash
# Install MCP Publisher
curl -fsSL https://modelcontextprotocol.io/install.sh | sh

# Login using GitHub
mcp-publisher login github

# Publish server
mcp-publisher publish
```

### Registry Validation

The `server.json` configuration is automatically validated against the MCP schema during CI/CD. To validate locally:

```bash
# Download schema
curl -s https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0/server.schema.json -o /tmp/mcp-schema.json

# Validate (requires jsonschema CLI)
pip install jsonschema
jsonschema -i server.json /tmp/mcp-schema.json
```
