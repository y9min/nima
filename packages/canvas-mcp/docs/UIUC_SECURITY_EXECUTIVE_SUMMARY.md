2. **Network Security**: HTTPS enforcement, proper User-Agent headers
3. **Local Processing**: No external data transmission
4. **Input Validation**: Type validation via `@validate_params` decorator
5. **Configuration Security**: `.env` file for secrets, excluded from version control

**Critical Gaps** ⚠️
1. **Code Execution Sandboxing**: Not implemented (HIGH RISK)
2. **Audit Logging**: No security event logging for PII access
3. **Token Encryption**: API tokens stored in plaintext
4. **MCP Client Authentication**: No authentication layer
5. **Security Monitoring**: No automated security alerts

## Hardened Release Plan: Baseline, Public, and Enterprise Tracks

Create a single codebase with three rigor levels, drive differences through configuration overlays, and gate releases with tier-appropriate controls and tests. See `docs/release/HARDENED_RELEASE_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` for the actionable work items and `docs/release/TIER_COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md` for the tier-to-control mapping.

### Track definitions and defaults
- **Baseline (current `main`)**: Target for contributors and early adopters. Enable hybrid code-execution sandboxing (container when available, local best-effort fallback), keep stdio transport (no bind), preserve anonymization toggle, and include redaction flags by default. CI must run lint + unit tests; security scans are advisory.
- **Public/individual instructor package**: Opinionated config focused on personal workstations. Enforce a sandbox outbound allowlist guard, document keyring/envelope token storage as planned, default log redaction/rotation hints, and optional “local-only” firewall guidance. Require the smoke security bundle (dependency scan, sandbox smoke, token validation) to pass before publishing.
- **Enterprise package**: Hardened overlay for multi-user and FERPA-bound deployments. Document MCP client authentication (API key or mTLS) and centralized secret management as planned, enforce an outbound allowlist guard, and include audit/access logging placeholders with retention. Release gating requires the full security test suite, SAST/DAST scans, and checklist sign-off.

### Release packaging and drift control
1) **Single trunk, overlay-driven**: Keep `main` as the source of truth; represent tier differences via configuration bundles (env templates/values files) and policy docs. Avoid code forks. Overlay files live in `config/overlays/`.
2) **Artifacts per tier**: Publish two artifacts per tag: `public` (baseline + public overlay) and `enterprise` (baseline + enterprise overlay). Document the default profile baked into each artifact.
3) **Compatibility matrix**: Maintain a living matrix mapping requirements/tests to each tier (must/optional). Update alongside releases to prevent silent drift (see `docs/release/TIER_COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md`).

### Operational runbook per tier
- **Baseline**: Weekly dependency scan; manual review of sandbox bypass reports; rotate API tokens quarterly.
- **Public**: Monthly smoke security bundle; verify keyring/encryption on install; provide auto-generated “quick hardening” checklist covering sandbox on, localhost bind, redacted logs, and offline token storage.
- **Enterprise**: CI-enforced SAST + dependency + full security suite on every PR; quarterly incident-response exercise; biannual pen-test; enforce log retention/rotation per policy and automated token expiration monitoring.

### Rollout steps to reach the plan
1. **Refactor configs into overlays** (baseline/public/enterprise) with defaults checked into version control.
2. **Codify gating** in CI: smoke bundle for public artifacts; full suite + SAST/DAST for enterprise.
3. **Document operator actions**: publish short, role-specific runbooks (workstation quick-start for public; SIEM/IdP integration for enterprise).
4. **Monitor for regression**: add a “tier drift” checklist to release notes; include hash/policy versions for overlays in artifacts.

## Risk Assessment

### Critical Risks
